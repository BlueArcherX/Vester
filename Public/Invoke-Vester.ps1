    .SYNOPSIS
    Test and fix configuration drift in your VMware vSphere environment.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Invoke-Vester will run each test it finds and report on discrepancies.
    It compares actual values against the values you supply in a config file,
    and can fix them immediately if you include the -Remediate parameter.

    If you are not already connected to the vCenter server defined in the
    config file, Invoke-Vester will prompt for credentials to connect to it.

    Invoke-Vester then calls Pester to run each test file. The test files
    leverage PowerCLI to gather values for comparison/remediation.

    .EXAMPLE
    Invoke-Vester -Verbose
    Using the default config file at \Configs\Config.ps1, Vester will run
    all *.Tests.ps1 files found inside of the current location, recursively.
    Verbose output will be displayed on the screen.
    It outputs a report of all passed and failed tests.

    .EXAMPLE
    Invoke-Vester -Script C:\Tests\ -Config C:\Tests\Config.ps1
    Vester runs all *.Tests.ps1 files found underneath the C:\Tests directory,
    and compares values to the config file in the same location.
    It outputs a report of all passed and failed tests.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-ChildItem -Path Z:\ -Filter *dns* -File -Recurse | Invoke-Vester
    Use Get-ChildItem to get all files below Z:\ with 'dns' in the name.
    Pipe those files into Invoke-Vester to run them as tests.

    .EXAMPLE
    Invoke-Vester -Script .\Tests\VM -Remediate -WhatIf
    Run all test files in the .\Tests\VM path below the current location.
    For all tests that fail against the values in \Configs\Config.ps1,
    -Remediate attempts to immediately fix them to match your defined config.
    -WhatIf prevents remediation, and instead reports what would have changed.

    .EXAMPLE
    Invoke-Vester -Config .\Config-Dev.ps1 -Remediate
    Run all test files in the current location, and compare values to those
    defined within the Config-Dev.ps1 file at the current location.
    For all failed tests, -Remediate attempts to immediately fix them
    to match the defined values.

    .INPUTS
    [System.Object]
    Accepts piped input via property name "FullName" (designed for Get-Item/Get-ChildItem)

    .NOTES
    This command relies on the Pester and PowerCLI modules for testing.
