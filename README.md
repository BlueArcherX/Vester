Vester
======================

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vester/badge/?version=latest)](http://vester.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Vester is a community project that aims to provide an extremely light-weight approach to vSphere configuration management using Pester and PowerCLI. The end-state configuration for each vSphere component, such as clusters and hosts, are abstracted into a simple config file. The configuration is tested--and optionally remediated--when drift is identified. The entire project is written in PowerShell.

March 2017: To learn how to use [Vester 1.0](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Vester/1.0.1), there is a [three-part blog series](http://www.brianbunke.com/blog/2017/03/07/introducing-vester/) and accompanying [video demo](https://youtu.be/6DYZR-xFt-4). (Which is really long. You've been warned.)
