Lab Config
======================

This is a community project that aims to provide an extremely light-weight approach to vSphere configuration management using Pester and PowerCLI. Each component monitored is both tested and remediated against drift. The end-state configuration is abstracted into a simple config file. The entire project is written in PowerShell.

# Requirements

You'll just need a few free pieces of software.

1. PowerShell version 4+
2. [PowerCLI version 5.8+](http://www.vmware.com/go/powercli)
5. [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester)
4. (optional) [Windows Management Framework 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395)

# Installation

Download the files contained within this project anywhere you want. You can even make different copies for different environments.

# Usage Instructions

1. Edit the `Config.ps1` file with your specific environmental variables for DRS, NTP, SSH, etc.
1. Open a PowerShell console.
2. Navigate to the project folder that you downloaded.
3. Run `Invoke-Pester` to launch the tests.

# Future

The community module is not officially supported and should be **used at your own risk**.

I'd like to see more tests added for things people find important. This will be done as time permits. :)
